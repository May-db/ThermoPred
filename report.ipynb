    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of our project is to find out whether the product created from two designated molecules is stable. Indeed, our vision is to ask a user to draw two molecules of his choice. Via the \"reaction_utils\" template, a product is created. To find out whether it was stable and whether the reaction was spontaneous, we also chose to calculate free enthalpies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Free enthalpy, or Gibbs free energy, ΔG is a thermodynamic function that determines whether a chemical reaction can occur spontaneously at constant temperature and pressure. It is calculated by the formula ΔG=ΔH-TΔS where H is enthalpy [J], T is the temperature [K] and S is the entropy [J/K]. A reaction is spontaneous if the variation in free enthalpy is negative. In our case,  If the enthalpy of the sum of the reactants is greater than that of the product, then the latter is stable. This concept is therefore essential for predicting chemical equilibrium and optimizing the conditions of chemical reactions, whether industrial or biological. Free enthalpy thus enables us to better understand the direction and feasibility of chemical transformations.\n",

    "# Materials and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "To reach our goal, which is to determine if the reaction of two given reactive is spontaneous or not at 0K, the problem was devided in multiple steps:\n",
    "1. First, a drawing interface was created to enable the users to draw their reactants.\n",
    "2. Then, the reactants were analyzed to determine what possible product they could yield using reaction templates. \n",
    "3. Finally, the energy of all molecules both reactants and product were calculated and compaired to conclude on the spontaneous character of the reaction at 0K.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this steps can be summaryze with this chart : \n",
    "\n",
    "Molecule ( Smiles “CCOC…”) → Convert into 3D (xyz) → Calculate energy → Compare energies\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Creating a drawing interface\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a drawing interface inspired by the materials provided in lecture 12 was created using streamlit and ketcher. The interface was designed for the user to draw the two reagents,enableling them to see their drawing as well as the corresponding smiles, 3D visualization and energy of the molecules. Also, after chosen the type of wanted reaction, the product was generated using a reaction template. To apply the same feature display functions as for the reactants, several format conversions were required, which made this step particularly challenging. Finally, we made sure that the reaction total energy was shown, and that if the reaction was favourable, we could see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main functions of this part was therefore to get the three functionalities of the drawn reagents. 'draw_and_process' indeed makes the link between the interface and the created functions : \n",
    "1. the user draws a molecule using the interface ketcher\n",
    "2. the SMILES is displayed\n",
    "3. the 3D molecular structure is generated using 'generate_3D' which is function that takes the SMILES and creates a 3D molblock\n",
    "4. the 3D structure is visualized using visualize_3D\n",
    "5. the molecular energy is calculated using the function'calculate_enrgy_with_rdkit'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code take the example of if the user has drawn the molecule CCO. Because keycher automatically converts the drawing into smiles such a function was not created. Therefore, in the example, the smiles of the molecule is directly given.   \n",

    "## 5. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface Usability\n",
    "The Streamlit-based user interface provided an accessible way for users to interact with complex computational chemistry tools. However, several areas for improvement were identified:\n",
    "1. The page \"jump\" to Molecule 2 disrupted the user experience. One way of solving it would have been to put the two interfaces for Molecule 1 and 2 next to each other, but then we would lose the sibebar for choosing specific atoms such as Br, O or S.\n",
    "3. Additional visualization options (like electrostatic potential maps) would enhance understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy of Template-Based Reaction Prediction\n",
    "The template-based approach provided a straightforward way to predict reaction outcomes for common reaction types. However, this method has inherent limitations:\n",
    "1. It can only predict reactions that match pre-defined templates\n",
    "2. It does not account for kinetic factors that might prevent thermodynamically favorable reactions\n",
    "3. Complex reactions involving multiple steps or rearrangements cannot be modeled\n",
    "\n",
    "For the simple reactions tested, our system showed good agreement with expected chemical behavior. For example, amide formation from carboxylic acids and amines is known to be thermodynamically favorable, which our calculations confirmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy Calculation Precision\n",
    "Our decision to use RDKit force fields rather than quantum mechanical methods introduced a trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy. While sufficient for relative comparisons, the absolute energy values should be interpreted with caution:\n",
    "1. Force fields like MMFF94s are parameterized for common organic structures and may be less accurate for unusual chemical environments\n",
    "2. The calculations do not explicitly account for solvation effects\n",
    "3. Zero-point energy corrections are not included\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Challenges\n",
    "Several significant technical challenges were encountered during development:\n",
    "1. __Segmentation issues with xTB__: Despite multiple attempts and alternative methods, we could not resolve these issues, leading to our adoption of RDKit\n",
    "2. __Molecular representation conversions__: Maintaining consistency across different representations (SMILES, molblock, 3D coordinates) required careful implementation\n",
    "3. __Exception handling__: Chemical calculations frequently encounter edge cases requiring robust error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "We successfully developed a computational system that predicts chemical reaction products and assesses their thermodynamic stability at 0K. Our approach combines:\n",
    "1. An intuitive molecular drawing interface\n",
    "2. Template-based reaction prediction\n",
    "3. Force field-based energy calculations\n",
    "4. Clear visualization of results\n",
    "The system effectively demonstrates the concept of using free enthalpy calculations to predict reaction spontaneity, providing a valuable educational and exploratory tool for chemistry students and researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Improvements\n",
    "Several enhancements could improve the system's capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implementation of quantum mechanical methods for more accurate energy calculations\n",
    "2. Expansion of the reaction template library to cover more reaction types\n",
    "3. Addition of temperature effects to predict reaction favorability under different conditions\n",
    "4. Integration of transition state modeling to address kinetic factors\n",
    "5. Improvements to the user interface to address identified usability issues\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the potential of computational approaches to provide rapid insights into chemical reactivity, potentially reducing the need for experimental trial-and-error in reaction development.\n"
